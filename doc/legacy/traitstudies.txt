* Understanding parallel morphological diversification in sister fish faunas 
(Brian Sidlauskas)

** Study overview 

Determine the cause of large-scale parallel evolution in the diverse
characiform fishes inhabiting the rivers of tropical South America and
Africa.  The strong evolutionary parallels between these sister faunas
suggest that the same evolutionary forces have driven the
diversification of both.
This research will synthesize measurements of morphological diversity,
evolutionary simulations, phylogenies, and detailed information about
ecology and anatomy to compare and explain the parallel evolutionary
histories of the two faunas.
Products will include the further development and distribution of a
new simulation-based test for heterogeneity in evolutionary rates that
can be applied to any sister group comparison (even when a phylogeny
is lacking or species numbers are unequal), reconstruction of the
history of diversification in these fishes, and identification of
aspects of ecology and morphology that may promote or restrict the
evolution of biodiversity whenever they arise.


** Data summary 

For each species, defined as (family + subfamily[opional] + genus +
species) and each publication that studies the species, record as much
of the following data as available: 

   - Museum identifier of a specimen and its type indicator (holotype,
     paratype, ...), who identified the species and when, whether the
     identity was verified [what is this?]
   - Body length measurements (mm, SL vs TL vs FL, is it the maximum).
   - Dietary info: dominant foods, other foods, life stage to which
     info applies, source of this info (stomachs of how many specimens). 
   - Location: country, river system, locality, latitude and longitude. 
   - Publication reference and location within it (page, figure) from
     where the data was taken.

When separate sets of data are available for several different values
of some of these parameters (e.g., observations in different rivers or
at different life stages), record them all as separate rows in the
database.

** Non-trait data 

*** Meta-information per row 
Identifying data (always present): 
  - Taxon: family + subfamily[opional] + genus + species
  - Species identified by: 
      -- Scientist(s)'s name 
      -- Year of ID
      -- "ID Verified?"  [what is this? most are empty]
  - Citation 

Other data (not always present): 
  - Indirect (Secondary) Citation [what is this?  rarely used]
  - Presumed Life History Stage (adult, juvenile, ...)
      [is this overloaded w.r.t. vitals vs diet?]
  - Location [is this overloaded w.r.t. vitals vs diet?]

Examples of pertinent entries from the row-wide Notes field:

  - "The paper was in German" [meaning "Some info might have been in
    the paper, but was not understood"?]
  - "information obtained from a very questionable paper"
  -  "June data can't be read"
  - "the geographic information makes note of more diversity in Amazon
    and Orinoco basins with less diversity in coastal rivers of the
    Guianas, the Sao Francisco River basin, and the shorter rivers
    from northeastern Brazil to Uruguay"
  - "Brazilian location, study probably examined a different species of Leporellus"
  - "probably more info in Santos 1981"
  - "Is this record in error??"


*** Citation 
Data: 
  - Brief label (e.g., "Lauzanne, 1973") 
  - Full free-text citation 
  - Location within a paper: Page # plus, if applicable, Figure #,
    Table #, Appendix # (both values within the same text cell)

Examples of pertinent entries from the row-wide Notes field:

  - "This was an online book which gave virtually no information about
    the editor or anything like that."

*** Location (of specimen collection or field observation) 
Data: 
  - Geo coordinates (latitude and longitude)
  - Country 
  - River system (a river name)
  - Locality (free text like "upper course of the Tucurui Reservoir",
    "city of Aripuana, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil", "island of
    Melia-Makilala in Lake Chad")

Examples of pertinent entries from the row-wide Notes field:
  - 
      
*** Meta-information about a specimen
Data: 
    - Museum 
    - Lot number 
    - Specimen Number within Lot (appears unused)
    - Type status (holotype, paratype, ...)

Examples of pertinent entries from the row-wide Notes field:
  - 


** Trait data 

*** Vital characters 
Data:
  - Body length, in mm, SL vs TL vs FL, is it the maximum).
  - Length Measure (SL, TL or FL)
  - "Is this cited as a maximum length?" (Yes, no, or blank)

Examples of pertinent entries from the row-wide Notes field:
  - "maximum of "mean length range""
  - "also, 70 mm TL"
  - "eating habits and maximum body length are noted for the entire
    species, therefore there is no distinct specimen citable for
    either of these data"
  - "supposedly reach about a meter in length, but 500mm was the max
    named for fish actually taken"
  - "size is in wild…in captivity it can reach 200mm SL"
  - "size is from in captivity…Taphorn notes "the largest specimens
    taken during this study didn't reach half that size"
  

*** Dietary habits 
  - Dominant food item(s) (free text or list of terms from a controlled vocabulary)
  - "Other Foods Present (in significant quantitites, >3% by volume)"
    (free text or list of terms from a controlled vocabulary)
  - Source of dietary info (when present, is usually of the form
    "stomach contents of NNN of specimens")
  - Trophic Classification (subset from a set of controlled values
    such as insectivore, algivore, piscivore, invertivore, frugivore,
    ...) -- appears to be the value to be synthesized from the above. 

Examples of pertinent entries from the row-wide Notes field:
  - "specimens sampled in April" (... October, June, ...) and
    "combination of all samples taken" -- here we have 6 or so rows
    that give more detailed dietary information than usual (with
    breakdown by months)
  - "diets documented according to size category" -- an idication that
    curator did some aggregation of source data before entering it
    into the spreadsheet?
  - "diet applies to the life history stage entered"
  - "stomach also contained sand"
  - "not entire diet"
  - "may only be part of diet"
  - "not necessarily primary diet, mentioned in passing"
  - "sponges may only be part of the diet"
  - "Presumably juvenile fishes/scales"
  - "insects, crustaceans, molluscs, fruits and seeds" [in an "omnivore" specimen]
  - "high water" and "low water" -- essentially splits the entry for
    the specimen in two, duplicating all the values except "Other
    foods", which differ.
  - "Algae at 3%"
  - "diet of the young primarily algae, adults seems to eat an
    increasing quantity of macrophytes"
  - "included stems and leaves"
  - "all specimens from october/december, yearlong diet may be broader"

** General observations 

  - The natural key for records is (almost):  taxon + citation 

  - There are various combinations of presence/absence for the groups
    of information above, since the goal was to collect _any_ info
    that was available.  Here are some patterns, though: 
    -- Entries that contain a museum specimen value usually provide
       some size measurement, but not dietary information. 


** More questions to be asked 

  - Is ajacency of two rows ever important in this spreadsheet? 

  - "ID Verified" field -- empty everywhere except Brian's own species
    identifications?

  - Location within a citation (Page#, Figure#, etc.)  -- now it is
    per whole record; would making it per field or per trait be
    useful?

  - Citation like "Sidlauskas personal observations" -- there must be
    many; is there need to disambiguate them?

  - Entries at the end of file: no full citations -- just not
    completed yet?

  - Is "Type Status" (holotype vs. paratype, vs none) important for
    data organization or processing or it is just a piece of info as
    any other?
  
  - Is "TypeStatus" a characteristic of the specimen (as a museum
    item) w.r.t. the taxon or is it an indicator of whether the
    citation was about a particular specimen?   

  - In "Species" column, values like "Sp. A", "Sp. C", "sp 1", "Sp?"
    -- meaning?  If this means that the author could not identify the
    species, how this info will be used in Brian's study?

  - While browsing, I could not see rows where "Citation" vs "Species
    identified by" + "Year of identification" contained different data
    -- are these fields supposed to go in lockstep?


* Evolution of whales and relatives 
(Samantha Price)

** Study overview
   [TODO: get from Samantha...]

** Data summary 
For each specimen, defined as a museum ID, record the following: 
  - Specimen reference [publication?], type (holotype, paratype, ..). 
  - Taxon (suborder + family + subfamily + Latin binomial).
  - Sex (if known) and estimated life stage.
  - Location info: country, textual description of the more precise
    location, geo coordinates, formation name and lithology description. 
  - Geological dating (period + epoch + age), date range, method of dating
  - Sizes of skeletal features (number + measurement unit), for the
    following: skeletal length, estimated body size with the
    estimation method used, endocranial volume, estimated brain size,
    scapula length, ....
    [are all of these data points from the publication, or some are
    estimates done by you?]
  - For each vertebra from 1 to 48: designation, length, width and
    height of centrum, units used for measurement. 
    [What is the difference between numbers 1 to 48 used for vertebrae
    columns vs the data in "vertebra designation"?]
  - EndNote bibliographic reference. 
  - "primary" vs "secondary" marker [what is this?]. 


** Non-trait data 

*** Citations 
  -- Textual strings from EndNote

*** Meta-data on the specimen 
  Data collected: 
  - Citation 
  - "primary" vs "secondary" marker [? whtr the original description or not?]. 
  - Specimen reference [how is this different from Citation], 
  - Type (holotype, paratype, ..., often missing). 
  - Taxon (suborder + family + subfamily + Latin binomial).
  - Fossil meta-data [see separate description]

  Notes: 
  - One source paper often contains data on more than one specimen and
    more than one species

*** Fossil meta-data
  Data collected: 
  - Location info: 
      -- country, 
      -- textual description of the more precise location, 
      -- geo coordinates [cited or estimated?]
  - Formation name 
  - Lithology description (Usually missing, only a couple entries:
    "Chocolate Limestone, Babia Stage (Berwali Series)", "soft,
    massive, fine sandstone")
  - Geological dating   
      -- (period + epoch + age), 
      -- date range (in "Ma", often is missing),
      -- method of dating [for the quoted date range?]
  

** Trait data 

*** Descriptive data on the specimen 
  - "Sex?" ["?" = "if known"?]   (always missing in the dataset)
  - Estimated life stage         (always missing in the dataset)

  - General measurements:  number + units 
    (Skeletal_length, Estimated_bodysize,
    Method_mass_or_length_estimate, Endocranial_volume,
    Estimated_Brain_size)
    (Very sparcely populated in the data set)
    [Need to find our which of these are quoted and which are computed]

Sample row-wide textual notes that seem pertinent:
  -- "Questionable identification; some speciments, at least,
     identified as Rodhocetus kasrani by Thewissen 1998 without
     explanation" (applied to 9 specimen rows from the same
     paper, which identifies all the specimens as "Indocetus ramani?")

  -- "Occipital condyle breadth identified as "distance between
     lateral margins of occipital condyles" (applied to 2 specimen
     rows from the same paper).

*** Vertebrae measurements 
 There are 48 vertebra for which info is collected, and for each vertebrae: 
    - designation [anatomic name for the bone?]
    - centrum length, width, and height  
    - measurement units for the above measurements

 - For a given specimen, far from each of 48 vertebra contains data

 - Record the raw reported data (e.g., use Imperial measurement units
    if this is what the paper reported) -- translation into uniform
    units is to be done later.

 - Some Designation values carry notes like "eroded", "?", "in
   articulation with S1". [meaning to be found out]

 - Some measurement numbers carry notations like "*" or "+" [meaning
   to be found out]

 - A record-wide textual not that pertains to vertebrae: 
    -- "identifies centrum widths specifically as "anterior"

** General notes / observations 

 - The main "skeleton index" for the data appears to be Species Name,
   however there are non-common complications: If info on multiple
   specimens within a species is available, or if there is conflicting
   info for a specimen, record it all -- disambiguation is to be done
   later.

** More questions to ask

  - "Primary_Secondary?" field: Whether the citation contains primary
    vs. secondary description of the specimen?  Possible uses? 

  - "Specimen Reference?" field: No values in the sheet. Would it
    duplicate "Endnote_ref"?

  - Is there significance to "?" in field names?: Primary_Secondary?,
    Specimen_reference?, Type? [holo/para/..]

  - Are geo coordinates quoted or esimated?  

  - Are Date_range and Method_of_dating  related? 

  - None of the following fields have any data in the sheet:
    Skeletal_length, Estimated_bodysize,
    Method_mass_or_length_estimate, Endocranial_volume,
    Estimated_Brain_size.
    Are they to be computed or this indicates sources had no data? 
    Generally, which columns are to contain computed data?  What if for
    some of those source papers do report some numbers?

  - Column Method_mass_or_length_estimate =?=> there could be
    different methods for mass/length estimates applied to different
    species.  Is it meaningful to apply subsequent traits analysis to
    mass estimates coming from different methods, or there have to be
    several traits analyses, segregated per mass method that was used?
    - Some lengths are "Starred" or "plussed", eg, 60.0* and 218+.
    What's the meaning?

 - What's the difference between the vertebra column number (Vertebra1
   ... Vertebra48) and vertebra designation value (e.g., Cervical, C3,
   Ca15, Ca1?, Posterior thoracic, T8, Proximal caudal, Proximal
   caudal (articulated with v. 34), S2 (in articulation with S1), C2
   (eroded) ...)

 - What are the differences in meaning between the three (or 4?) kinds
   of designation values above?

 - If there is no data for Vertebra N?: Paper had no data vs. this
   specimen is not supposed to have Vertebra N?

 - Some vertebrae designations are question-marked, e.g. "T5?". Is
   this meta-info for "Author was not sure" field?

 - Interesting length values (e.g., for Vertebrae 15 and 16): 
      "84 (posterior epiphysis missing)"
    Something for a note field?  

 - What is the "natural backbone" for the data collection?
   Species name? SpecimenID? SpecimenID + Citation?
   [What if several papers provide info for the same
   specimen?]

geologic period.  Data recorded for each such species: 
   - Taxon (as order + family + genus + species), 
   - Environment, motility. 
   - Geological time period: period, period midpoint ["Ma" - in
     millions of years?], epoch, stage. 
   - Size measurements: length, width, thickness, mass.
   - Computed biovolume and info about the formula and method used for
     the computation.
   - Fossil info: lithology, location, formation, regional and local
     environments.
   - Provenance info: literature reference for size data and for the
     original species description, experts contacted, other sources.


* Evolution of plant mating systems
(Mixed Mating WG)

** Study description 
Background: Plant mating systems cover the continuum from
self-pollinating to mixed to fully cross-pollinating.  Morever,
significant portion of plant species is capable of using several kinds
of fertilization.

Broad question: How do various genetic, developmental, evolutionary,
ecological, temporal and spatial factors influence where a plant's
population lies on the mating continuum?

Factors that are hypothesized to play role: 

  - Pollen limitation, which can be caused by geographic location of a
    population within the species' range (central vs. the edge), which
    in turn influences pollinator visitation and density of pollen
    donors.
  - Reproductive assurance of selfing. 
  - Relative costs and benefits of selfing vs. outcrossing. 
  - Inbreeding depression in the species -- a complex genetic factor
    caused by the expression of deleterious recessive alleles and
    manifested as self-progeny being less vigorous than outcross
    progeny.

** Data summary
    [see also 
     https://www.nescent.org/wg/mixedmating/index.php?title=Database_Requirements]

  -- Data per species: 
     - Taxonomic name (reference(?) + family + genus + species).
     - General plant features: taxcat (monocot, dicot, gymnosperm),
       biome (tundra, rainforest, ..), growth form (herb, tree, ...),
       life history (annual, perennial, ...).
     - Average of latitudes for which outcrossing rate was measured. 
     - Sexual system (hermaphroditic, heterostylous, ...), presence of
       a self-incompatibility mechanism.
     - Flowering details: flower size, flower size variability among
       genotypes or populations, flowers per inflorescence, number of
       inflorescences, inforescence variability among genotypes or
       populations, dichogamy, herkogamy, floral symmetry.
     - Pollination details: reproduction in the absence of
       pollinators, pollinators (a subset of: insect, bee, fly, ...,
       wind, water), presence of nectar,
     - Combined list of references from which the data was derived.

  -- Data per population: 
     - Taxon name (family + genus + species) 
     - Outcrossing: population name (if named by investigators),
       population type (natural, experimental, ...), year for which
       estimates were made, measurements and standard errors for
       various progeny indicators: F, tm, ts, paper reference and
       location in the paper where the data were reported.
     - Inbreeding depression: measurements and standard deviations,
       for inbred vs. outcrossed populations, of fitness
       characteristics (such as seed number per cross, proportion of
       seeds from crosses, seed weight, germination rate, juvenile
       survival, adult survival, fecundity, vegetative size) at
       diffferent developmental stages (seed, germination, juvenile,
       adult).
     - Experimental pollination: population's name and country,
       measurements of various reproductive characteristics (fruits
       per flower, seeds per fruit, ...) under various treatments
       (Fci, Fio, Fis, Fin, Fen [what are these?]).
