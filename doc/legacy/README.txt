The documentation in this directory represents requirements studies
and related artifacts from very early on in the conceptualization of a
trait data management application at NESCent.

Contents:

* needs.txt: Needs Assesement 
* vision.txt: Product Vision 
* traitstudies.txt: Descriptions of data collected in a few trait-based studies.
    - 2 studies with detailed descriptions
    - 2 studies with brief descriptions
* features-sink.txt: Kitchen sink of features, requirements, open questions, etc.

This is very unpolished documentation, and much has been superseded or
subsequently evolved. It is kept here primarily for archival purposes.
