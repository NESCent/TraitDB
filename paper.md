# Summary

TraitDB is a web application built to facilitate storage, searching, subsetting, and sharing trait data.

TraitDB has been used by multiple [NESCent](http://nescent.org/) working groups to  assemble datasets from different researchers into a single uniform dataset. Guided by a flexible YAML template system, TraitDB's import process provides validation feedback on CSV files and individual data cells to promote consistency and completeness.

TraitDB presents several options for browsing, subsetting, and downloading data via its web interface. It can summarize trait data over different taxonomic levels, and has been used to gather and prodice datasets hosted by the [Tree of Sex](treeofsex.org).
